An End-to-End Project on Historical Cinematic Data.

**Part 1)** Data collection via API requests, Data Cleaning, Python class construction, multi-iterative network mapping/graphing with exponential node/edge 
mechanism using common co-relational feature (co-actor network).

**Part 2)** Creating normalized tables, importing data, and implementing vertical partitioning for efficiency. Analytical queries identified high-scoring movies, 
prolific actors, and collaborative pairs, while indexing optimized retrieval speed. Additionally, full-text search capabilities were employed to analyze textual 
data in movie overviews.
